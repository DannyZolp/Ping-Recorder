# Ping Recorder
![Make Binaries](https://github.com/DannyZolp/Ping-Recorder/workflows/Make%20Binaries/badge.svg)

A simple system that grabs a whole bunch of servers for the client to ping, and then makes a file that you can analyze to see where ping is higher or lower. Grabs servers from a static API and outputs a JSON file with all of the collected information.
